# Black Hole Simulation - macOS Release v1.0.0

## 📦 Pre-compiled Binaries

This release contains optimized binaries for macOS systems:

### 🎮 Available Programs

1. **`cpu_black_hole`** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
   - CPU-based physics simulation
   - Best compatibility across all macOS systems
   - Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
   - Stable performance (~8-9 FPS)

2. **`black_hole`** 
   - GPU-accelerated version (may have limitations)
   - Requires OpenGL 3.3+ support
   - May fail on some macOS systems due to compute shader issues

3. **`2d_lensing`**
   - 2D gravitational lensing demonstration
   - Lightweight visualization tool
   - Great for educational purposes

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Download and extract release
# Then run:
./cpu_black_hole
```

### 🎮 Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Left Mouse Drag | Orbit camera around black hole |
| Mouse Wheel | Zoom in/out |
| Right Mouse | Toggle gravity simulation |
| G Key | Toggle gravity effects |
| Space | Toggle geodesics rendering |

### 📋 System Requirements

- **OS**: macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later
- **Architecture**: Intel x86_64 or Apple Silicon (Universal support)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Graphics**: Any integrated or dedicated GPU with OpenGL 3.3 support

### 🔧 Dependencies

These binaries are compiled with static linking where possible, but you may need:

```bash
# If you encounter library errors:
brew install glew glfw glm
```

### 🍎 Optimization Notes

- Compiled with `-O3` optimization
- Includes `-march=native` for current hardware
- Universal binary support for Intel/Apple Silicon
- Optimized for macOS Metal-backed OpenGL

**macOS Adaptation:** This release

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Program won't start:**
```bash
# Check if libraries are available
otool -L ./cpu_black_hole

# Install missing dependencies
brew install glew glfw glm
```

**Poor performance:**
- Use `cpu_black_hole` instead of `black_hole`
- Close other graphics-intensive applications
- Ensure your Mac isn't in low-power mode

**Window creation fails:**
- Ensure you're running in a proper terminal environment
- Try running from Terminal.app instead of SSH
- Check that your macOS version supports OpenGL 3.3

### 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Tested on various Mac configurations:

| Hardware | CPU Version | GPU Version |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| M2 MacBook Air | ~9 FPS | ~12 FPS* |
| M1 MacBook Pro | ~8 FPS | ~10 FPS* |
| Intel iMac (2019) | ~7 FPS | ~8 FPS* |

*GPU version may fail on some systems
